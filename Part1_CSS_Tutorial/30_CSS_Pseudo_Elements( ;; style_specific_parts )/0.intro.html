<!-- 
 What are Pseudo-Elements?
A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specific parts of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

Style the first letter or line, of an element
Insert content before or after an element
Style the markers of list items
Style the viewbox behind a dialog box

SYNTAX:

selector::pseudo-element {
  property: value;
}
-->


<!-- 
Notice the double colon notation - ::first-line versus :first-line

The double colon replaced the single-colon notation for pseudo-elements in CSS3. This was an attempt from W3C to distinguish between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.

The single-colon syntax was used for both pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in CSS2 and CSS1.

For backward compatibility, the single-colon syntax is acceptable for CSS2 and CSS1 pseudo-elements.
