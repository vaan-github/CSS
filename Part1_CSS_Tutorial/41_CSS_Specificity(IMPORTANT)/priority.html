The cascade algorithm has 4 distinct stages.

1. Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear
2. Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match
3. Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS
4. Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type

order of specificity is:

!important flag > Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector

Specificity Calculation

1. Universal Selector: 0
2. Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1
3. Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10
4. ID selectors: 100
5. Inline styles: 1000
6. !important flag: 10,000


# NOTE :
  PRIORITY OF THE CSS :
 inline CSS > internal CSS > external CSS
