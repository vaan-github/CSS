<!-- 
 All links in HTML are underlined by default. Sometimes you see that links are styled with no underline. The text-decoration: none; is used to remove the underline from links, like this:
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
a {
  text-decoration: none;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Using text-decoration: none</h1>

<p>A link with no underline: <a href="https://www.github.com/vaan-github">Aniket</a></p>

</body>
</html>
