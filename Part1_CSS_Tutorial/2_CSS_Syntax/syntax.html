 CSS Syntax :
 1. The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
 2. The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
 3. Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
 4. The declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
