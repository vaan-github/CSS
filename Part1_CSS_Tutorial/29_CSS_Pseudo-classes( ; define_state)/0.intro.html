<!-- 
 What are Pseudo-classes?
A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

Style an element when a user moves the mouse over it
Style visited and unvisited links differently
Style an element when it gets focus
Style valid/invalid/required/optional form elements

Syntax:

selector:pseudo-class {
  property: value;
}
