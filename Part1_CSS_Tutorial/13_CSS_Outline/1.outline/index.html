<!-- CSS Outline -->
<!-- An outline is a line drawn outside the element's border. -->

<!-- 

CSS has the following outline properties:

outline-style (same as border)
outline-color
outline-width
outline-offset
outline

Note: Outline differs from borders! Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.
