<!-- CSS Colors -->

<!-- 
 Colors are specified using predefined color names, or RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, HSLA values.
-->

<!-- 

1. RGB
* Full Form: Red Green Blue
* Description: Represents colors using the three primary colors of light (red, green, and blue). Each component has a value from 0 to 255.
* When to Use: Use RGB when you need precise control over colors based on the primary color channels (e.g., for digital screens). It's common in image manipulation, web design, and where numeric control over light-based color is essential.
* Example: rgb(255, 0, 0) represents pure red.

2. HEX
* Full Form: Hexadecimal
* Description: A color model where colors are represented using hexadecimal values (base-16). Each color channel (red, green, blue) is denoted by two hexadecimal digits.
* When to Use: Use HEX when you want compact color codes or when you’re working with legacy systems. It’s widely used in web development because it's shorter and easier to read for developers familiar with hex notation.
* Example: #FF0000 represents pure red (equivalent to rgb(255, 0, 0)).

3. HSL
* Full Form: Hue Saturation Lightness
* Description: A color model based on three components:
#Hue: the type of color (angle on the color wheel from 0 to 360°),
#Saturation: the intensity of the color (0% is grayscale, 100% is full color),
#Lightness: how light or dark the color is (0% is black, 100% is white).
* When to Use: Use HSL when you need intuitive control over colors, particularly when you want to adjust colors based on brightness or intensity. It’s helpful for designing UI themes where visual adjustments are important.
* Example: hsl(0, 100%, 50%) represents pure red.

4. RGBA
* Full Form: Red Green Blue Alpha
* Description: Same as RGB but includes an alpha channel to define the opacity of the color (from 0, fully transparent, to 1, fully opaque).
* When to Use: Use RGBA when you need colors with transparency, for example, in overlaying elements, semi-transparent backgrounds, or text. It allows for more complex visual effects.
* Example: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5) represents semi-transparent red.

5. HSLA
Full Form: Hue Saturation Lightness Alpha
Description: Same as HSL but with an alpha value for transparency (from 0 to 1, where 0 is fully transparent, 1 is fully opaque).
When to Use: Use HSLA when you want intuitive color control (like HSL) along with the ability to handle transparency. It's useful for creating fluid and visually appealing UI designs with layered, semi-transparent elements.
Example: hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5) represents semi-transparent red.

# NOTES :

 1. IN RGB and HEX :Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all the 3 light sources.
 2. IN HSL : Shades of gray are often defined by setting the hue and saturation to 0, and adjust the lightness from 0% to 100% to get darker/lighter shades.
