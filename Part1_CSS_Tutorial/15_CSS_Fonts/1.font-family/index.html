 ## Generic Font Families
1. Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.
2. Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.
3. Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look. 
4. Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.
5. Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.

Tip: The font-family property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system, to ensure maximum compatibility between browsers/operating systems. Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family (to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available). The font names should be separated with a comma.
